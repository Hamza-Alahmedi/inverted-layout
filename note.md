## Inverted Layout Exercise

#### Exercise Instructions:

**Objective:** Create a React application with two pages (Home and About) and implement a responsive navigation bar that adapts its style based on the current page. Utilize React Router 6 for page navigation and ensure a visually appealing design following the provided [Figma design](https://www.figma.com/file/ycxM7haKHArwgw1ZADCWtu/inverted-layout?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=UtWgpXJRDriqX9OT-1).

**Requirements:**
1. **React App Setup:**
   - Set up a new React application using `create-react-app` or `create vite`

2. **React Router 6 Integration:**
   - Install React Router 6 in your project.
   - Implement a basic routing structure with two pages: Home and About.

3. **Navigation Bar Component:**
   - Create a reusable Navigation Bar component (`NavBar`) that includes:
     - Logo section.
     - Navigation links for Home and About.
     - Social media links.
     - Styling to handle the inverted layout (transparent on Home, white on About).
     - Highlight the current page link (e.g., bold style).

4. **Page Components:**
   - Create separate components for Home and About pages.
   - Each page should display relevant content to distinguish them.

5. **Routing and Linking:**
   - Utilize the `<Link>` component from `react-router-dom` for navigation in the `NavBar`.
   - Ensure that clicking on the navigation links correctly navigates the user to the corresponding page.

6. **Inverted Layout Styling:**
   - Implement the inverted layout as per the Figma design:
     - On the Home page, the navigation bar should be transparent.
     - On the About page, the navigation bar should be white.

7. **Bold Current Page Link:**
   - Implement a style that makes the link of the current page bold to indicate the active state.

8. **Testing:**
   - Test your application to ensure that navigation works as expected, and the styles change based on the current page.

9. **Bonus (Optional):**
   - Enhance the design further based on your creativity.
   - Add animations or transitions to the navigation bar for a smoother user experience.

**Submission:**
- Upload your completed project to GitHub.
- Share the GitHub repository link with your mentor for evaluation.

**Notes:** 
- Ensure that your GitHub repository is set to public or grant access to your mentor for reviewing the code and design.

- Feel free to customize the design and add additional features to challenge yourself further.
